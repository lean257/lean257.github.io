I am currently a product manager at an AdTech startup in New York. I code in JavaScript and Python. <br />
I just graduated from Grace Hopper Web Development Bootcamp in October 2017. Prior to GH, I spent 4 years as a Product Manager at tech companies both small and large size. <br />
Previously, I have 5 years of experience as a financial consultant before going to business school at Wharton/Upenn. <br />
In my free time, I run marathons & triathlons. I am currently training for an Ironman. I love being outdoors, and have traveled to 50+ countries.
